# This document provides a detailed record of the calculation results of the 
# Residue-Residue Contact Score (RRCS) from GROMACS trajectories. RRCS is a 
# quantitative metric used to describe the interactions between residues within 
# a protein, specifically reflecting the degree of proximity between residues 
# in three-dimensional space. This metric is crucial for understanding the 
# dynamic changes in protein structures and their functional realization.

# Columns:
# - Frame: Indicates the frame index in the GROMACS simulation trajectory.
# - Residue1: Lists the identifier of the first residue involved in the RRCS calculation.
# - Residue2: Lists the identifier of the second residue involved in the RRCS calculation.
# - RRCS: Displays the RRCS calculation score for the corresponding residue pair.

# Note: Here are the refined results, where only those with higher scores are retained.

# Note: For a comprehensive understanding of RRCS theory and its critical applications 
# in protein structure analysis, please refer to our research published in 
# eLife, "Common activation mechanism of class A GPCRs." This study explains 
# the principles of RRCS and demonstrates its use in revealing the activation 
# mechanisms of class A GPCRs.
